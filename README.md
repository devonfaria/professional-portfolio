## Description

Welcome to the backend of the landing page for my professional protfolio! This project only uses one html and one css file, with a folder of images for your convenience. Use this page format for your own purposes!

The web page when deployed will have links to the page sections in the nav bar, a screen-responsive design, clickable image links to separate web applications, and a "contact me" section with links. 

## Visuals

The following layout is what you can expect to see on your browser.
